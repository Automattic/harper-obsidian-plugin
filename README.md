Put simply, [Harper](https://writewithharper.com/) is a grammar checking plugin that doesn't violate your privacy.
Other systems, like LanguageTool, ship your writing over the internet to centralized servers, where it's used for god-knows-what.
Harper isn't like that.

Instead, Harper runs its grammar checking engine directly _inside Obsidian_.
That means your data doesn't go anywhere you don't want it to.
Your Obsidian vault should be just what you expect: locked down and private.

Unlike other offerings (like Grammarly) Harper also explicitly ignores the contents of code fences and inline code blocks.
Since it runs entirely on-device, Harper also ends up being noticeably faster than alternatives, partly because there is no network latency.

### Open Source

- Harper is fully open source, allowing transparency and community contributions to improve its functionality.
- Developers can review the codebase or contribute directly via the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/automattic/harper).
